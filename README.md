Backend
Create a .NET Web API that takes ZIP-code as a parameter, then outputs city name and current temperature. 
Include documentation with any necessary build instructions and be prepared to discuss your approach.
Use the Open WeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api) current weather API to retrieve the current temperature and city name. You will be required to sign up for a free API key.

Frontend 
Create a modern SPA front-end (preferably an angular app) that allows a user to input a zipcode, then output the response-message to the page, utilizing the tool you created above.

Additionally - optional
Additionally, you can implement saving the history of queries in the database. And then displaying the history in the SPA as a list of cards.

Assistance and completion
Youâ€™re free to email a ZIP/tar file, use GitHub, Plunker, etc.
